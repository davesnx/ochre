## 1.1.0

- Add built-in `plaintext`/`text`/`txt` languages that produce unstyled tokens without a grammar, in both the library and the CLI.
- Add `?options` and `?extra_themes` to `Ochre.to_string`, giving the runtime-format API the same HTML capabilities as `Ochre.to_html`.
- Report the real package version from `ochre --version` instead of a hardcoded string.
- Preserve source line endings across tokenization, CLI input, and rendered output.
- Reject multi-theme transforms that produce incompatible token structures.
- Count decoration positions as Unicode scalar values instead of UTF-8 bytes.
- Report CLI input and theme loading failures without uncaught exceptions.
- Document all CLI flags, bundled grammars, and dual-theme HTML output in the CLI reference.
- Deploy API documentation and dual-theme/ANSI/tokens previews to GitHub Pages.
